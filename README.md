### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), ...

I have developed front-end apps using AngularJS and Ember. But I skipped the React bandwagon and went to learn Elm. Through this project I hope to learn and use React for a small app.
