# dipper

Dipper is a Star Wars Trivia Generator written using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and [SWAPI](https://swapi.co).

I have developed front-end apps using AngularJS and Ember. But I skipped the React bandwagon and went to learn Elm. Through this project I hope to learn and use React for a small app.

### Project

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. There are many [tutorials](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) on React, but itâ€™s best to start from the [basic](http://jamesknelson.com/learn-raw-react-no-jsx-flux-es6-webpack/) of React itself. Using React and the modern web development workflow tools require a lot of configuration. Thus, usually we start with a boilerplate code. Two of the [many](https://risingstars2016.js.org/#react-template) React boilerplates are: [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [React Boilerplate](http://reactboilerplate.com/). This project is started using the Create React App boilerplate.

Dipper uses the the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co) (SWAPI) to generate trivia or random bits of information about the films, people, planets, species, starships, and vehicles of the Star Wars universe. Dipper is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) which is a new service for quickly rolling out static websites. It supports custom domains, SSL, built-in form submissions, API Proxy, etc.
